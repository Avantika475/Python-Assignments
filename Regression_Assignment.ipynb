        "\n",
        "The relationship between X (independent variable) and Y (dependent variable) must be linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "Meaning:- as X changes, Y changes in a roughly straight-line pattern.\n",

        "2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals (errors between predicted and actual values) must be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "No pattern should exist among errors.\n",
        " Example: One error should not affect another otherwise, it shows correlation in residuals.\n",

        " 3. Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)\n",
        "\n",
        "The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of X.\n",
        " If errors spread more at high X values, that means heteroscedasticity  which violates this assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "The residuals should be normally distributed (bell-shaped curve).\n",

        "In SLR, we use only one independent variable, so this is not a big issue.\n",
